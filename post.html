                    To get you started the right way, here are a handful of useful beginner-level articles to browse through first:
                    
                    Head over to my article about what coding and web development is. The free coding guide will teach you how the Internet works, what programming languages can do for you, and what tools you need. Also, you’ll find out what web developers do.
                    Learn HTML and CSS first. They’re the most essential, fundamental tools you need to become a professional web developer. Start with free tutorials on Codecademy or freeCodeCamp. For more resources, head over to my favorite HTML and CSS courses.
                    Start learning JavaScript and jQuery. You will use them to add interactivity to your static web pages. Together with HTML and CSS, they’ll be your main tools if you want to become a front-end web developer. Again, feel free to use the free resources on Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp.
                    Practice your skills a lot as you go through your online courses. Make sure you don’t just follow tutorials 1-to-1 but apply what you learn to projects of your own. This will help you combine all the tools you’re learning to build real-life websites from scratch.
                    Step by step, you’ll start feeling more comfortable working with these tools. And these four steps will get you far, trust me.
                    
                    Also, really take the time to practice and get familiar with each tool before moving on to the next one.
                    
                    You want to feel 100% comfortable with each language because these tools build on top of each other as you go. Learning them one by one is like laying a solid foundation of your entire coding learning journey.
